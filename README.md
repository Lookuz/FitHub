# FitHub
## Introduction

_FitHub_ is an Android Application Development idea by Choong Wey Yeh and Rohan Dev, for Orbital 2018, a Summer Independent Software-Development Project hosted by National University of Singapore, School of Computing, that is focused on improving access to fitness services in Singapore.

Through this application, we aim to improve current services and support for identifying fitness services in various locations, and also provide users with the necessary relevant and fast information about these fitness services.
We also wish to incorporate user-based sharing aspect of GitHub to allow users to contribute to community of people devoted to maintain a healthy and fit lifestyle, and tap into the knowledge of the community and professionals. With these functionalities in mind, we hope to increase the public's access to knowledge about fitness and the relevant services around them so that they would be able to make the right lifestyle decisions.
Hence, the name of the idea, _FitHub_.
