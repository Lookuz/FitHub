# FitHub
## Introduction

_FitHub_ is an Android Application Development idea by the group _Codekien Mee_ Choong Wey Yeh and Rohan Dev, for Orbital 2018, a Summer Independent Software-Development Project hosted by National University of Singapore, School of Computing, that is focused on improving access to fitness services in Singapore.

## Problem

The problems expressed by youths who find it difficult to transit into an active and fitness-oritented lifestyle, localised to Singapore, are as follows:

- Difficulty in finding locations to carry out physical activities. For example, People who want to play basketball may not be sure of which prime spots are available in a specific area.
- Overcrowding at various fitness centers such as gyms. Especially prominent for people who are working, the prime time for them to gym would be after work around the time 7 - 10pm. However, with a large crowd of working adults have the same idea, this leads to overcrowding at certain busy areas such as CBD, central, etc.
- Unsure of which workout routine is most beneficial for them. Many youths who are still schooling are eager to jump straight into weightlifting and heavy equipment . However, this often leads to them being injured due to their inexperience with such equipment and exercises.

## Idea

Our research have indicated that there have been past efforts to introduce convenience to users actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle, such as _KFit_ and _Keelo_, but we realised these apps provide very specific functionalities, who are more suited for people who have already had experience with gym fitness, not to mention that most have a subscription cost.

With this in mind, we present our project idea, _Fithub_. _Fithub_ is a android based application that aims to solve the problems mentioned above by our brave interviewees, by catering to gymrats and newbies alike through 2 main initial functionalities:

### 1. Location-Based Identification

The first functionality allows users to _**identify services for fitness and sports within a specified radius**_, and in a location of their liking.

Additionally, the application will allow users to _**store their favourite locations**_, and gym spots (e.g favourites, home, work..)

Users can specify their preferred area(s) of carrying out their regime. Wish to gym somewhere near your house? Just key in your house address in the settings. Want to gym after work instead? No problem, set workplace address as favourites and youâ€™re good to go!

We also plan to include an _**additional functionality to tell users how crowded each location is**_ based on user registration, and service centres. This provides users with additional information on which services they wish to use based on overcrowding, reducing long waiting times.

### 2. User-Content Sharing

Our idea for this application, _FitHub_, was inspired by the platform GitHub which allowed users to control, update, share and modify existing code on the web posted by other users.

We adopted a similar idea by establishing a social networking platform on our application, that will allow _**users to post their favourite gym routines and regimes on their profile**_. Hence, the name _FitHub_.

These users are then able to _**share their gym regimes**_ which may be specific to certain area fitness, and other users will be able to _**view, commend and modify**_ these regimes as their own. 

In addition, _**users can post questions which can be answered by other users, who may have their answers commended**_(similar to upvoting on Reddit), which adds an extra validity to these answers as people can trust answers that are highly recommended by multiple users.

## Improvements

- _**Remote checking-into gyms, and also remote booking of various facilities for sports.**_ Got off work late, but have an urge to play basketball with friends? Using remote booking and checking systems, we can implement smooth usage of facilities by booking on the go, increasing convenience of users.

- _**Tracking frequency of use of specific machines at various gyms**_. People who aim to train specific muscle groups of their body, may find it useful to identify gyms where the machines they intend to use are less frequently used.
